Download Docker and make sure Docker is running, then proceed to search images for the following:
ghcr.io/project-osrm/osrm-backend
OSRM should pop up; proceed to press the button to pull the image and wait for it to finish. If everything went correctly, it should now be visible in the images tab.

Download the map for the Netherlands from Geofabrik:
https://download.geofabrik.de/europe/netherlands-latest.osm.pbf

Go to Docker Desktop again and click on "Terminal," which should be in the bottom right, and run the following command, replacing <your-path> with the folder where your map is saved:

docker run -t -v "<your-path>:/data" osrm/osrm-backend osrm-extract -p /opt/car.lua /data/netherlands-latest.osm.pbf

The command can is extracting the car routes and can take a while.

Proceed to open PowerShell and run the following to ensure there is no conflict when setting up a bicycle routing server later:
Get-ChildItem <your-path>\netherlands-latest.osrm* | Rename-Item -NewName { $_.Name -replace "netherlands-latest", "netherlands-car" }

After renaming, return to the Docker terminal and run the following commands:
docker run -t -v "<your-path>:/data" osrm/osrm-backend osrm-partition /data/netherlands-car.osrm
docker run -t -v "<your-path>:/data" osrm/osrm-backend osrm-customize /data/netherlands-car.osrm

After these commands have successfully run, the local server can be launched using:
docker run -t -v "<your-path>:/data" -p 5000:5000 osrm/osrm-backend osrm-routed --algorithm mld /data/netherlands-car.osrm
the local host will be on port 5000, as is expected in the code for the dashboard.

The Bicycle server setup is almost the same. Open an additional Terminal in Docker and run:
docker run -t -v "<your-path>:/data" osrm/osrm-backend osrm-extract -p /opt/bicycle.lua /data/netherlands-latest.osm.pbf

PowerShell command for renaming:
Get-ChildItem <your-path>\netherlands-latest.osrm* | Rename-Item -NewName { $_.Name -replace "netherlands-latest", "netherlands-bicycle" }

Go back to the Terminal in Docker where the bicycle routing server will be set up, enter the following:
docker run -t -v "<your-path>:/data" osrm/osrm-backend osrm-partition /data/netherlands-bicycle.osrm
docker run -t -v "<your-path>:/data" osrm/osrm-backend osrm-customize /data/netherlands-bicycle.osrm

Command to launch the bicycle server:
docker run -t -v "<your-path>:/data" -p 5001:5000 osrm/osrm-backend osrm-routed --algorithm mld /data/netherlands-bicycle.osrm
the local host will be on port 5001, as expected for the dashboard

Lastly, if the OSRM servers are setup locally, go into "app.py" and uncomment line 374-378 and comment line 381 additionally line 385 batch_size = 100. The dashboard will now send requests to the local server. If you want to use online requests reverse the comments again and make sure batch_size = 10.
